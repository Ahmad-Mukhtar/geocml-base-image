# Mach 30 Python Workspace (Kasm Image)

## Introduction

This repo provides a workspace for Mach 30 volunteers to work on Python projects based on the [Ansible based template for KASM Ubuntu Focal Images](https://github.com/j-simmons-phd/kasm-core-focal-template) template provided by @j-simmons-phd.  The workspace is configured with the following software:

- git cli
- [Keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain)
- Chrome
- Python 3.8.x (part of the image template) with the following packages (not part of the image template)
    - pip
    - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
    - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
    - [Voil√†](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
    - [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- VS Code with the following extensions (note, auto-updates are disabled)
    - [Python extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

## How to Use this Repo

1. Clone this repo
1. Change directory into the cloned repo 
1. Run `docker-compose build` to build the workspace image (see [Issue #1](https://github.com/j-simmons-phd/kasm-core-focal-template/issues/1) if you encounter an error in Step 1/15 for manual steps to correct the issue).  Note, debugging build errors is easier when you switch the docker-compose [progress mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_build/#options) to plain (`docker-compose build --progress plain`)

## Using the image locally

Once built, the image can be pushed into the Kasm server per Kasm documentation or it can be run locally on port 6901 using docker-compose.

- **Starting the image locally:** Run `docker-compose up -d`
- **Stopping the image locally:** Run `docker-compose down`

When running locally, the workspace can be accessed at https://localhost:6901 with
- **User:** `kasm_user`
- **Passwordd:** `password`
